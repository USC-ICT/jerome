The list of broken things

- JavaScript integration between Engine and the SCXML interpreter. For example,
	returning an utterance form c++. And the rest of the stuff, needs to get fixed
	and tested.
  15/09/24 - the initial implementation is done. Need more testing.

- Training. need a call back to control training process. Have a timeout.
	15/09/21 - API is done. Timeout can be done inside the callback

- Training. Figure out the best optimization algorithm and parameters.

- NPCEditor csxml is different from the alib csxml.
  15/08/25 - fromat version 2 on NPCEditor side. Might need to store classfier description.
	15/09/20 - format has been change to add classifier model
	15/09/20 - changes are still pending in NPCEditor to supoprt the latest in Jerome
	15/09/21 - Fixed NPCEditor to generate the format that Jerome reads.
							It stil does not store the classifier model, so Jerome will
							interpret each classfier as unigram-to-unigram mapping.

- Add support for utterance count that exists in the latest NPCEditor
	15/08/25 - format version 2 loads and saves the counts.
							Need to include them into computation.

- Adopt the Factory pattern for IO

- Adopt the Factory pattern for Trainer

- Write RankerProvider that handles all possible ranker, i.e, Unigram, Bigram,
	Unigram + ID. Replace the current Unigram with that implementation.

- Figure out a better way for registering Factory-based components.
